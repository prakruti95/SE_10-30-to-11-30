1. Inheritance:

Design and implement a payroll system for a company.
 The system must handle multiple types of employees such as:

FullTime

PartTime

Intern

Contractor

Each employee type has a different salary structure, and 
may include allowances, bonuses, deductions, or hourly wages.
All employee types must share common data like:

Employee ID

Name

Department

Joining Date

Additionally, include:

Specialized roles like Manager or TeamLead (can be derived from FullTime).

A common base class Employee from which all types inherit.

A method to calculate net salary that should be 
implemented/overridden in each derived class.



2. Inheritance with Polymorphism:
Design a banking system that handles different types of bank accounts, such as:

SavingsAccount

CurrentAccount

FixedDepositAccount

RecurringDepositAccount

All accounts must inherit from a common base class BankAccount, which stores:

Account number

Account holder name

Balance

Branch name

Opening date

Each account type should implement its own version of the following:

calculateInterest()

withdraw()

deposit()

displayAccountDetails()

3.create a loan counting system suppose that i took a loan of 5 lakh on 8% intrest 
for 7 years
so how many EMI i need to pay with exact amount and also give me loan
ending date.
